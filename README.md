# health-informatics-neuronal-network-configuration

Most of us are unaware of neuroid networks. Therefore, the network configuration and initialization team chose to work on a simple network which makes it simple for everyone to understand. The User will enter the input on the front-end page as no. of neuroid in the input layer, hidden layer and output layer and we take the input from vector and produce the matrices. So, Basically we are working on 2 neuroid in input layer,3 neuroid in the hidden layer and 1 neuroid in the 
output layer.
